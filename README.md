# Java Hackerrank Practice 🚀

Welcome to my **Java Hackerrank Practice Arena** – a collection of solutions I wrote while solving **Hackerrank Java challenges**.  
This repository reflects my journey of improving **problem-solving, Java fundamentals, and algorithmic thinking** one problem at a time.

---

## 📌 Overview
- Platform: Hackerrank (Java domain)
- Language: **Java**
- Problem types: From **basic syntax & loops** to **OOP concepts & advanced challenges**
- Purpose: Strengthening **DSA & Java coding skills** through consistent, deliberate practice

## 📂 Repository Structure

Java-Questions-Hackerrank/
│
├── Day_01/ → Introductory problems
├── Day_02/ → Conditionals, loops, strings
├── Day_03/ → Arrays, methods
├── Day_04/ → OOP concepts (classes, inheritance, interfaces)
└── ... → More days/problems added regularly

- Each folder contains Java files named after the problem.
- Solutions include comments explaining approach, edge cases, and time/space notes (when relevant).

## 📝 Sample Problems Covered
- Java Stdin & Stdout
- Java If-Else
- Java Loops I & II
- Java Strings Introduction
- Java Anagrams
- Java BigInteger
- Java Exception Handling
- Java Inheritance & Interfaces

## 🚀 How to Run

1) Clone the repository  
    (indentation used instead of nested code fences so this whole README stays in one block)

    git clone https://github.com/sourav-357/Java-Questions-Hackerrank.git

2) Open in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code).  
3) Run any `.java` file from the corresponding `Day_xx` folder.  
   - If a problem requires input, use your IDE’s run configuration or the terminal to provide stdin.

## ✅ Conventions I Follow
- **Filename:** mirrors the Hackerrank problem title (spaces → underscores).
- **Methodology:** clear input parsing → core logic → result printing.
- **Comments:** brief explanation of approach; mention edge cases.
- **Complexity:** note time/space complexity for non-trivial solutions.

---

## 📖 Learning Outcomes
- Sharpened **Java syntax mastery** (loops, strings, arrays, OOP).
- Stronger **problem-solving patterns** (two-pointers, hashing, sorting, stack/queue).
- Better code structure and readability for **interview-style challenges**.
- Solid foundation for **DSA and competitive programming**.

---

## 🔄 Roadmap / Next Steps
- Add unit-test style runners for select problems.
- Group advanced problems by topic (Strings, Collections, Math, OOP).
- Track solved count and difficulty levels.
